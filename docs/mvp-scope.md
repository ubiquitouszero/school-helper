# School Helper App - What Should We Build First?

**Date:** January 8, 2026
**Decision Makers:** Kaland Carroll (Product Manager) & Valen Carroll (Beta Tester)
**Builder:** Dad (Developer)

---

## How This Works

We can't build everything at once. We need to pick what goes in **Version 1** (the first version we can actually use) and what waits for later versions.

Each feature has **points** - bigger numbers mean more work for Dad to build.

Circle YES or NO for each feature. Dad will add up the points.

## MUST HAVE (Core App)

These are required for the app to work at all.

| Feature | Points | Include? |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Pick your name from a list | 3 | YES (required) |
| Choose a subject (Math first) | 3 | YES (required) |
| Math problems appear on screen | 3 | YES (required) |
| Tap to answer (multiple choice) | 3 | YES (required) |
| Show if you got it right or wrong | 2 | YES (required) |
| **Subtotal** | **14** | |

## ADD UP YOUR POINTS

**Kaland's Math Problem:**

You are building an app with your dad. The app needs some features that are required (Must Have = 14 points). You also picked some extra features from each section.

Add up the points for everything marked YES, then find the total.

**Show your work:**

| Category | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Must Have (required) | 14 |
| Kaland's Features | _____ |
| Valen's Features | _____ |
| Fun Stuff | _____ |

**Work:**

```
  14   (Must Have)
+ ___  (Kaland's Features)
+ ___  (Valen's Features)
+ ___  (Fun Stuff)
------
  ___  TOTAL
```
