# School Helper App

**A learning app built by a dad and his kids, for kids everywhere.**

---

## What Is This?

School Helper is a fun learning app that helps kids practice math, reading, and more. It's being built by:

- **Kaland Carroll** (age 9, 3rd grade) - Product Manager
- **Valen Carroll** (age 5, Kindergarten) - Beta Tester
- **Dad (Bert Carroll)** - Developer

This project is also a learning experience for Kaland - teaching him how software is built, how to work with AI tools, and how to solve real problems.

## Features (Planned)

### For Kids
- Math drills (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Number recognition (for younger kids)
- Sight words practice
- Progress tracking with charts
- Trophy system (Bronze, Silver, Gold)
- Easy/Medium/Hard modes
- No typing required (tap to answer)
- Challenge mode (try harder grades)

### For Parents/Teachers
- Admin dashboard to see how players are doing
- Simple setup (no complicated logins for kids)

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Frontend | Astro + React |
| Database | Supabase |
| Hosting | Netlify |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |

## Development Approach

This project uses AI-assisted development with Claude Code. We're building fast so the kids can see results quickly and stay engaged.

### Key Principles
- **Ship quickly** - Kids need to see progress
- **Keep it simple** - No overengineering
- **Kid-tested** - Kaland and Valen test everything
- **Learning exercise** - Teaching Kaland about software development
